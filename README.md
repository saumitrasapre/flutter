# Flutter
Android app development practice codes using Google's Flutter framework.

Flutter is a mobile UI framework developed by Google used for cross platform app development. It uses the ‘DART’ language (also
developed by Google) for implementing smartphone applications. Flutter comes with Google’s material design framework OUT-OF-THE-BOX,and is
optimised with Firebase to be used for back-end tasks. 
  
  Flutter provides us with the functionality to have a single codebase for Android and iOS. This eliminates the need to develop separate
apps for these two types of devices.
